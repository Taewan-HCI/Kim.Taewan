        <p>
        My name is <b>Taewan Kim</b>, and I work as a researcher and designer at Samsung Electronics (Corporate Design Center). I specialize in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Human-AI Interaction (HAII), focusing on creating interactive systems that enhance collaboration between people and AI technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
        My research has centered on designing AI-enhanced interactive systems that respect user values and autonomy. I have developed tools that facilitate self-reflection through collaboration with AI, supporting individuals to discover personal insights. Additionally, I have explored the use of VR and AI to support autistic individuals in the workplace by boosting their self-advocacy and agency, focusing on empowerment rather than behavior modification.
        </p>
        <p>
        By leveraging my expertise in <b>Mixed-method research</b> and <b>Human-centered design</b>, I create artifacts, methodologies, and frameworks that promote meaningful and beneficial AI-augmented experiences. These contributions aim to enrich the work of both HCI researchers and practitioners.
        </p>


<!-- 

        My name is <b>Taewan Kim</b>, and I am a designer & researcher at Samsung Electronics (Coporate Design Center) where I integrate generative AI into the design processes for enhancing creativity and productivity.

        As a researcher in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with a design background, I explore Human-AI Interaction (HAII), grounded in a deep understanding of people. My research focuses on collaborative approaches between humans and AI to enhance mental health, particularly through reflective practices that foster self-awareness and address a range of conditions from everyday stress to clinical psychiatric disorders.

        I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Industiral Design speicialized in Human-Computer Intearction at KAIST, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.notion.so/2021dt4c/Hwajung-Hong-cc10b0291bbe4ca38dbf4882cd687423"><b>Hwajung Hong</b></a>.

        </p> -->
<!-- 

        Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Industrial Design at <b>KAIST</b>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.notion.so/2021dt4c/Hwajung-Hong-cc10b0291bbe4ca38dbf4882cd687423"><b>Hwajung Hong</b></a>. I am currently a member of the <a href="https://dxd-lab.github.io/"><b>DxD Lab</b></a>. Before joining KAIST, I completed my M.E. in Creative Design Engineering from UNIST and my B.S. in Industrial Design from Handong University.</p>

        <p>As a researcher in <b>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</b> with a design background, my focus is on <b>Human-Centered AI Interaction</b> design. My approach revolves around understanding people's needs deeply, with a special emphasis on creating AI systems that foster mental well-being. The work I have contributed has been presented at renowned HCI conferences such as ACM <b>CHI, CSCW,</b> and <b>DIS</b>.</p>

        <p>By combining my strengths in <b>Mixed-method research</b> and <b>Human-centered design</b>, I develop artifacts, methodologies, and frameworks that inspire meaningful and positive algorithmic experiences for both HCI researchers and practitioners.</p> -->

          <!-- <p>Currently, my research explores the role of <b>Large Language Models (LLM)</b> in fostering reflective behaviors among individuals. I am particularly interested in leveraging LLMs to support self-reflection and mental well-being.</p> -->
<!--        Specifically, I focus on designing AI systems to support peoples’ self-reflection for <u>mental health</u>.-->

<!--        <p>Recently, I investigated exploiting prediction algorithms and explainability that facilitate self-reflection-->
<!--            for the mental-wellbeing (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3517701">Accepted to CHI 2022</a>). I-->
<!--            also explored design space of human-social bot interaction for assisting users on revisit their past-->
<!--            experiences by support-giving experience with the bot (<a-->
<!--                    href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376743">Accepted to CHI 2020</a>).</p>-->

<!-- Specifically, my work aims to design AI systems that support mental well-being. My research approach involves 1) designing research artifacts that enable the exploration of human-AI interaction (HAI) design opportunities, and 2) extracting empirical findings through in-the-wild studies that help us understand the impact of these systems on people's behavior and cognition.  -->
