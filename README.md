## 👋 Hi there 

I'm Taewan Kim, a Ph.D. student in Industrial Design at KAIST, advised by Prof. [Hwajung Hong](https://hwajunghong.com). My research focuses on designing everyday human-AI interaction with a human-centered design approach. I create artifacts, methodologies, and frameworks to inspire meaningful and enjoyable interaction design. Prior to entering KAIST, I received his M.E in Creative Design Engineering from the UNIST where I was advised by Prof. Hwajung Hong. I also hold a B.S in Industrial Design from Handong University.
