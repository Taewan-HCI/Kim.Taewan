# Taewan Kim
Hi there 👋

I’m a Ph.D. student studying Human-computer Interaction (HCI) at [KAIST](https://kaist.ac.kr), advised by Prof. [Hwajung Hong](https://hwajunghong.com), as a member of DxD (data interaction design) Lab.

**My research interests are**

|**Algorithmic user experience (Human-AI interaction)**|**Interactive system for mental & physical wellbeing**|
|:---|:---|
|- Studies focusing on exploring and understanding the algorithmic user experiences.|- Studies focusing on designing interactive systems for mental & physical wellbeing.|
|- Studies for developing systems and tools for designing and evaluating in the algorithmic experience.|- Studies for understanding how people use technology for their mental & physical well-being.|
