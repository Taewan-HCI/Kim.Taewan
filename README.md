Hi there 👋

I’m a Ph.D. student studying Human-computer Interaction (HCI) at [KAIST](https://kaist.ac.kr), advised by Prof. [Hwajung Hong](https://hwajunghong.com), as a member of DxD (data interaction design) Lab.


# Research Interests

### Algorithmic user experience (Human-AI interaction)
- Studies focusing on exploring and understanding the algorithmic user experiences.
- Studies for developing systems and tools for designing and evaluating in the algorithmic experience.*

### Interactive system for mental & physical wellbeing
- Studies focusing on designing interactive systems for mental & physical wellbeing.
- Studies for understanding how people use technology for their mental & physical well-being.
