## 👋 Hi there 

I'm Taewan Kim, a Ph.D. student in Industrial Design at KAIST, advised by Prof. [Hwajung Hong](https://hwajunghong.com). My research focuses on designing everyday human-AI interaction with a human-centered design approach. I create artifacts, methodologies, and frameworks to inspire meaningful and enjoyable interaction design for people. Prior to entering KAIST, I received his M.E in Creative Design Engineering from the UNIST where I was advised by Prof. Hwajung Hong. I also hold a B.S in Industrial Design from Handong University.

**My research interests are**

* **Algorithmic user experience (Human-AI interaction)**
  * Studies on understanding and designing the everyday algorithmic user experiences

* **Interactive system for mental & physical wellbeing**
  * Studies for understanding how people use technology for their mental & physical well-being
  * Studies on designing interactive systems for mental & physical wellbeing
