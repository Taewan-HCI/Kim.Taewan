## 👋 Hi there 

**I’m a Ph.D. student studying Human-computer Interaction (HCI)** at [KAIST](https://kaist.ac.kr), advised by Prof. [Hwajung Hong](https://hwajunghong.com), as a member of [DxD (data interaction design) Lab](https://url.kr/79wt13).

**My research interests are**

* **Algorithmic user experience (Human-AI interaction)**
  * Studies on understanding and designing the everyday algorithmic user experiences

* **Interactive system for mental & physical wellbeing**
  * Studies for understanding how people use technology for their mental & physical well-being
  * Studies on designing interactive systems for mental & physical wellbeing
